# To run on the GEN trees, and save the Higgs PT shape for all the given mass points, listed in the file, rootfiles.txt, do: 

python FillTrueHistograms.py -s 

This will also open the mono-x.root and save the RECO MET histogram in the rootfile, if it exist, otherwise do nothing. 


# To run on the shapes just produced by previous step, and create the gen weights by taking ratio of the gen Higgs pT, 
  - target / base 
  in fine bins and save the new weight histogram, do
 
python FillTrueHistograms.py -w 


# To reweight the histograms event by event and normalise to cross-section do: 

python FillReweightedHistograms.py -s
